# polygon → swaths & bursts (Sentinel-1 SLC)

Given a Sentinel-1 SLC product and an area of interest — inline WKT, or a WKT or
GeoJSON file — return the sub-swaths and the bursts that the AOI intersects.

**Role in Vigisar.** `polygon_to_swaths_bursts.py` is the burst-selection step of
the SLC preprocessing pipeline: the wrapper `run_graphs.polygon_to_swaths_bursts`
calls it on the reference product and feeds the resulting `subswath` /
`first_burst` / `last_burst` to the `TOPSAR-Split` node of `backscatter.xml` and
`coherence.xml`, once per intersecting sub-swath. It also parses the `--aoi`
argument of every preprocessing entry point, which is why an AOI can be given as a
file there. The pipeline always runs it in **coarse mode** — see *Strict mode vs.
coarse mode* in section 3 for why. The module is self-contained and can still be
run on its own, from the command line or from Python (section 4).

## 1. The problem

A Sentinel-1 IW SLC product covers ~250 × 170 km and weighs 4–8 GB; an area of
interest usually covers a few square kilometres of it. Processing the whole product
to study that patch wastes hours of computation and tens of gigabytes of disk.

Every SAR toolbox offers a burst selection step (`TOPSAR-Split` in SNAP, its
equivalents in ISCE or GAMMA), but they all expect the answer to be already known:
*which* sub-swath, and *which* burst numbers inside it. Finding them by hand means
eyeballing burst outlines in a GUI and writing down indices — slow, error-prone, and
impossible to script over a stack of a hundred dates. This tool answers it
programmatically:

> input: a path to an SLC product + a polygon (WKT or GeoJSON)
> output: `{"IW1": [1, 2], "IW2": [2, 3]}`

It needs only conda-forge packages (numpy, shapely, geopandas), and never opens the
multi-gigabyte image data.

## 2. How Sentinel-1 IW products are organised

**Sub-swaths.** In IW mode (Interferometric Wide swath), the radar cycles its
antenna across three adjacent sub-swaths — **IW1** (closest to nadir), **IW2**,
**IW3** — spanning the ~250 km swath; the EW mode works the same way with five.
Adjacent sub-swaths overlap by 1–2 km, so the coverage has no gap.

**Bursts.** The antenna is also steered *along* the track (the TOPS technique),
chopping each sub-swath into short takes called **bursts** of about 20 km, around
nine per sub-swath in a standard slice. Consecutive bursts overlap by roughly a
kilometre — the margin that lets the deburst step stitch them seamlessly, and that
interferometry exploits for azimuth calibration (ESD).

**On disk.** A `.SAFE` product is a directory (often distributed zipped):

```
S1B_IW_SLC__1SDV_20170804T215105_..._B333.SAFE/
├── measurement/            one GeoTIFF per sub-swath × polarisation (the pixels)
├── annotation/             one XML per sub-swath × polarisation (the metadata)
│   ├── calibration/
│   └── rfi/                radio-frequency-interference reports
└── manifest.safe
```

Within a measurement file, bursts are stacked as **tiles of identical size**,
`linesPerBurst` lines each. Valid data does not fill its tile: the edges, where the
synthetic aperture is incomplete, are zeroed (*black-fill*), the real extent being
recorded line by line in `firstValidSample` / `lastValidSample`.

---

## 3. The method

Everything needed is in the annotation XML; the image data is never read.

**Step 1 — Collect the annotation files.** `annotation/s1*.xml`, read straight from
inside the `.zip` when the product is still archived. `calibration/` and `rfi/` are
skipped: same header structure, no geometry.

**Step 2 — Deduplicate polarisations.** One annotation file per sub-swath *and* per
polarisation (6 for a dual-pol IW product); VV and VH image the same ground, so only
the first polarisation of each sub-swath is kept.

**Step 3 — Cut the image into bursts.** From `swathTiming/linesPerBurst` and the
burst list: burst *k* occupies azimuth lines `[k · linesPerBurst,
(k+1) · linesPerBurst]`.

**Step 4 — Turn line numbers into ground coordinates.** The `geolocationGrid` is a
sparse list of tie points mapping `(line, pixel) → (latitude, longitude)`. The
decisive property: **its rows sit on the burst boundaries**, so no interpolation is
needed.

```
line=0     •  •  •  •  •  …  •      ← top edge of burst 1
line=1500  •  •  •  •  •  …  •      ← burst 1 / burst 2 boundary
line=3000  •  •  •  •  •  …  •      ← burst 2 / burst 3 boundary
line=4499  •  •  •  •  •  …  •      ← last line of the image
```

**Step 5 — Rebuild each burst footprint.** Take the grid row at the burst's first
line left to right, then the row at its last line right to left, and close the ring:

```
first line, increasing pixel  →   A ─ B ─ C ─ D ─ E
                                  │               │
last line, decreasing pixel   ←   J ─ I ─ H ─ G ─ F
```

Reversing the second row keeps the ring from crossing itself. Keeping every tie
point rather than just four corners lets the polygon follow the burst's real
curvature. The row is picked as the one *closest* to the computed boundary rather
than strictly equal to it — the last grid row sits at `numberOfLines − 1`.

**Step 6 — Parse the area of interest.** WKT inline or from a file, GeoJSON from a
file only — quoting JSON on a command line is error-prone, so inline GeoJSON strings
are rejected with an explicit message. The format is detected from the content, not
from the file extension; a multi-feature `FeatureCollection` is merged into one
geometry. Coordinates in lon/lat (EPSG:4326), the convention of both Sentinel-1
annotations and GeoJSON (RFC 7946).

**Step 7 — Handle the antimeridian.** Longitude jumps from +180 to −180 in the
Pacific, which would turn a straddling footprint into a polygon wrapping the wrong
way around the globe. When a ring's longitudes span more than 180° — impossible for
a genuine burst — negative longitudes are shifted by +360. The AOI gets the same
treatment and is tested together with its ±360° copies, so the frames match either
way.

**Step 8 — Intersect and summarise.** Footprints go into a GeoDataFrame
(EPSG:4326), shapely tests them against the AOI, and the hits are grouped into
`{swath: [burst numbers]}` — 1-based within each sub-swath, as in SNAP's
`TOPSAR-Split`.

### Strict mode vs. coarse mode

Footprints are **edge-matched**: consecutive bursts share their boundary row and
touch without overlapping, whereas the real valid data overlaps by about a
kilometre — asymmetrically, since the upstream burst extends past the seam while the
downstream one starts with a few hundred metres of black-fill *after* it.

So an AOI whose edge falls near a seam may need a burst the strict test misses.
`coarse=True` (`--coarse`) dilates the footprints by `coarse_margin` (2 000 m by
default) **for the test only**, returning those neighbours; the geometries in the
result stay undilated. Use it whenever the AOI is not comfortably inside a single
burst — one extra burst is cheap, and the deburst step handles the duplicated strip
cleanly.

The margin is given in metres but applied in degrees, since the footprints stay in
lon/lat: it is converted at the product's mean latitude using the longitude scale
(111 km × cos φ), the smaller of the two, so that the dilation reaches at least the
requested distance in every direction. Along the meridian it over-reaches at high
latitude (2 000 m E-W is 4 000 m N-S at 60°), which is the safe side for a
recall-oriented test. Converting the margin rather than reprojecting the
footprints keeps the antimeridian frame (step 7) valid.

**Why the Vigisar pipeline defaults to coarse.** The module itself defaults to
strict, because as a standalone tool the exact answer is what one asks for. The
pipeline (`run_graphs.polygon_to_swaths_bursts`) flips the default to `coarse=True`
because the two possible errors do not cost the same:

- *A missing burst is silent and expensive.* The AOI is also the `Subset` clip
  applied after terrain correction, so if a burst covering part of it was not
  split out, nothing fails — the final GeoTIFF simply has a nodata hole where that
  burst should be. It only surfaces downstream, as a block of spurious "changes"
  (or no change at all) in the detection, with no hint that the cause is a burst
  index chosen weeks earlier.
- *An extra burst is visible and cheap.* It adds one ~20 km tile to
  `TOPSAR-Split`, i.e. a few seconds per graph, and `TOPSAR-Deburst` stitches the
  overlap exactly as it does for any two consecutive bursts. The clip then
  removes what lies outside the AOI anyway.

Since the footprints are only accurate to about a kilometre near the edges (they
come from the geolocation grid, not from `firstValidSample`), a ~2 km dilation is
the margin that makes the first error practically impossible without blowing up
the second. Pass `coarse=False` to the wrapper to reproduce the module's strict
result.

### Known limits

- Footprints derive from the geolocation grid, not from `firstValidSample` /
  `lastValidSample`; they are accurate to roughly a kilometre near burst edges.
- Burst numbers are local to the product — they are not the ESA global burst IDs.
- The AOI must be in lon/lat WGS84; a polygon in a projected CRS (Lambert-93, UTM)
  must be reprojected first, and `POLYGON((lon lat, …))` is longitude-first.
- An AOI legitimately wider than 180° of longitude would be mistaken for an
  antimeridian crossing.

## 4. Usage

### Install

Nothing to add: numpy, shapely and geopandas are already part of the `vigisar`
environment (`vigisar_env_light.yml` / `vigisar_env_full.yml`). `--geojson` writes
through geopandas, which relies on pyogrio, also present.

### Command line

From the repository root, with the `vigisar` environment active:

```bash
# inline WKT, strict test
python src/preprocess/polygon_to_swaths_bursts.py --slc-path product.SAFE --polygon "POLYGON ((2.2 48.8, 2.5 48.8, 2.5 49.0, 2.2 49.0, 2.2 48.8))"

# AOI read from a GeoJSON file, recall-oriented, JSON output
python src/preprocess/polygon_to_swaths_bursts.py --slc-path product.zip --polygon aoi.geojson --coarse --json

# also export the footprints of the selected bursts
python src/preprocess/polygon_to_swaths_bursts.py --slc-path product.zip --polygon aoi.wkt --geojson hits.geojson
```

Running it by hand is a quick way to check which bursts the pipeline is about to
process — use `--coarse`, which is what the pipeline does.

```
Intersecting swaths: IW1, IW2
  IW1: bursts 1, 2
  IW2: bursts 2, 3
```

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--slc-path PATH` | **required** — the `.SAFE` directory or `.zip` archive |
| `--polygon AOI` | **required** — inline WKT, or a path to a WKT / GeoJSON file |
| `--coarse` | dilate footprints before the test (favours recall) |
| `--coarse-margin METRES` | dilation margin in metres, default `2000` |
| `--json` | print `{swath: [bursts]}` as JSON instead of text |
| `--geojson PATH` | write the footprints of the selected bursts to a file |

`python polygon_to_swaths_bursts.py --help` prints the same description as this
section.

### Python

```python
from src.preprocess.polygon_to_swaths_bursts import get_intersecting_bursts, load_burst_footprints

hits, summary = get_intersecting_bursts(
    "product.SAFE",
    "aoi.geojson",        # or a .wkt file, an inline WKT string, or a dict
    coarse=True,          # optional, default False
    coarse_margin=2000,   # optional, metres
)
# summary -> {"IW1": [1, 2], "IW2": [2, 3]}
# hits    -> GeoDataFrame (swath, polarisation, burst, geometry)

footprints = load_burst_footprints("product.SAFE")   # every burst, for inspection
```

The pipeline uses the same call through a thin wrapper, which is what the graph
runners consume:

```python
from src.preprocess.run_graphs import polygon_to_swaths_bursts

polygon_to_swaths_bursts("product.SAFE", "aoi.geojson")   # coarse=True by default, see section 3
# -> [{"subswath": "IW1", "first_burst": 1, "last_burst": 2},
#     {"subswath": "IW2", "first_burst": 2, "last_burst": 3}]
```

`first_burst` / `last_burst` are the min / max of each sub-swath's list, because
`TOPSAR-Split` takes a contiguous range. A single convex polygon always hits a
contiguous run of bursts; a multi-part or very concave AOI may leave a gap, which
the range then simply fills in — a few extra bursts, never a missing one.

### Visual check

The original notebook, with a folium map drawing every burst of the product (the
selected ones in red, the AOI in blue), lives in the `geo` repository
(`polygon_to_swaths_bursts/polygon_to_swaths_bursts.ipynb`); it is not part of
Vigisar. `hits.explore()` on the GeoDataFrame gives the same picture in any notebook.
